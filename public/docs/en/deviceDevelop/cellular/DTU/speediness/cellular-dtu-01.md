# Operations on Developer Center

## __1. Log in to Developer Center__

Log in to <a :href="toDevelopCenter(null, 'en')" target="_blank">Developer Center</a> . Click <a :href="toDevelopCenter('registerType', 'en')" target="_blank">Register Now</a> to finish the registration if you have not registered an account.

## __2. Create a Project__

A project is a collection of products. You need to create a new project before you can perform operations such as product creation or device management.

## __3. Create a Product__

Creating a product is the first step in the product development process. A product is an abstract description of devices defined by the Developer Center for managing similar devices. For example, if you have a temperature and humidity device with LTE network connection capability, and you need to access the Quectel device management platform to complete device monitoring, you can define it as a product: "Smart Temperature and Humidity Sensor".
