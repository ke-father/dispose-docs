# Overview

## **Introduction**

> This tool enables users to quickly configure product information and function definition of Modbus slave devices through a graphical configuration interface. The generated configuration files can be directly imported with TSL model on Developer Center. The tool can also download the configuration files of the device, etc., which greatly reduces the development work of Modbus devices.

## **Background**

> There are a large number of Modbus devices on the market, and many users have the demand for intelligent transformation of the devices, but the cost of customized development of the corresponding DTUs is too high, so there is an urgent need for a DTU that can be compatible with the standard Modbus protocol devices on the market to reduce the cost and time of the entire device access. Developers purchase this Modbus DTU and use the PC tool to graphically configure Modbus meter information and function point to generate a standard TSL model file and a device file with codeless development. After importing TSL model file to Developer Center and downloading the device file to DTU, developers can realize the collection and control of data on Developer Center by using DTU to interconvert Modbus device data and TSL model data.
