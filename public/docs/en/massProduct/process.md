**2.Purchase activation codes:**<br />
● We provide 100 free activation codes for each product under enterprise accounts (20 free activation codes for each product under individual accounts) for product development. After the device activation codes are used up, you need to purchase new activation codes if you newly produced devices need to access Developer Center.  <br />

## **Trial Production**

Before mass production, we suggest you to carry out trial production and verify the software and hardware functions and stability of the products with the mobile terminal and the back-end terminal.

## **Mass Production**

After the function verification is passed in trial production, mass production can be carried out.

If cellular products are provided to App users, the QR codes of the devices needs to be generated for device binding. See [Device QR Code](/en/massProduct/QRcode.md).

## **Activate Device**

After the devices are produced, it is recommended to activate the devices on the production line to avoid device failures caused by license insufficiency or other reasons after delivery.
