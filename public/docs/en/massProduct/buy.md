# How to purchase a license?

When the free activation codes are used up, you need to purchase new activation codes to enable the new devices to access Developer Center.

You can contact the local sales staff for price consultation, and the sales staff will promote the entire activation code purchase process for you.  

You can also contact us at <csc@quectel.com> to purchase the activation codes.

After you purchase the activation codes, we will assign the activation codes to the products you need to produce, and then the activation codes can be used for your devices to access Developer Center.
