# Release Product

This document introduces product release, the last step in product development process.

Product release is a lock on the current product state, so that some important data cannot be arbitrarily modified. Its main purpose is to prevent unavailability of devices or data parsing error caused by console misoperations.

## **Prerequisites**

● A product has been created.<br />
● A TSL model has been defined for the product.<br />
● A device has been developed and debugged successfully.<br />
● The device of the product is in activated state.

## **Steps**

Differences in operation permissions before and after product release can be viewed on "Release Product" page. You can click "Release" to release the product after you have confirmed that all information is correct. The product enters a stable state after it is released. At this time, it is not recommended to modify the product information arbitrarily to avoid affecting the products that have been sold.

3.Cancel the product release. If you need to modify the product information, you can click "Cancel" to unlock the product and release the product again after you modify the information.
