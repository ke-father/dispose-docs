# Test in Production

This document introduces production testing, the fourth step in product development process.

## **Prerequisites**

● A product has been created.<br />
● A TSL model has been defined for the product.<br />
● A device has been developed and debugged successfully.

## **Steps**

1.After logging in to Developer Center, click the product panel or "Device Development" button on the panel to start the product development process.

2.After finishing production testing, click "Next" button or click "Test in Production” tab to enter "Test in Production" page.

3.Production testing includes device QR code management and production testing process guide.

## **Device QR Code**

We provide a generation and management solution for device QR codes of cellular devices. See [Device QR Code](/en/massProduct/QRcode.md) for details.

## **Production Testing Process Guide**
This page introduces production testing schemes for products which use different network connection methods, including lite testing process and cloud testing process . You can select the proper testing process according to the actual situation of production line.

**Lite Testing Process**: It is more suitable for scenarios requiring high production testing speed, but it is recommended to conduct spot checks on the network connection ability and feature testing of the devices.

**Cloud Testing Process**: The verification of connection ability of devices is added to cloud testing process on the basis of the lite testing process. It is more suitable for scenarios requiring high product quality.
