# Device Debug

This chapter introduces the third step of product development, device debug.

## **Precondition**

● A product is created.<br />
● The module corresponding to the device type of the product is purchased.<br />
● A device is developed according to Device Development in Document Center and accesses Developer Center. For the development process, see [Develop Development](/en/deviceDevelop/preliminaries.md) for details.

## **Procedures**

1.Log in to Developer Center and click **"Develop Device"** on a product panel, and you can start the product development process. 

2.Having developed the device, click "Next: Debug Device" or "③ Debug Device" to enter the "Debug Device" page.

3.Click **"Add a Device"**, and you can manually add devices with different authentication types.<br />

Dynamic Authentication: When the product-level dynamic authentication is disabled, only the added devices can access Developer Center through ProductKey and ProductSecret for authentication and obtain DeviceSecret.<br />

Static Authentication: Only devices with DeviceSecret downloaded in advance can be connected to Developer Center. Developer Center will reject the authentication applied by the device whose DeviceKey and DeviceSecret are unmatched.<br />

After a device with static authentication is added successfully, you can obtain DeviceSecret generated for the device on the "Device Details" or "Manage in Batches" page.<br />

Note: The device with static authentication as authentication type can only be added to the product with MQTT and LwM2M as Radio Access Technology.

Device with X.509 Certificate: Developer Center allows device to use its own X.509 certificate for authentication. The CA certificate must be uploaded before the device is connected to the platform.

When adding a device in the authentication type of X.509 Certificate to Developer Center, you can choose to input the corresponding device certificate fingerprint. If not, the fingerprint will be generated by the certificate used in the initial connection of the device, and the subsequent connection will be matched and verified by the generated fingerprint.

The device certificate fingerprint should be calculated by SHA-1, such as openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha1 -in certfile.crt. The fingerprint generated by openssl has the mark ":". You need to remove the ":" and upload a 40-bit hexadecimal string.

4.Click **"Device Debug"** in the "Action" bar to enter the "Device Debug" tab.

The left panel is the data sending panel, and the right one is the debugging real-time log panel. When the device is online, you can send data on the left panel, and you can view the data uplink from the device to Developer Center on the Communication Logs panel.

If the data format of the product is Transparent Transmission/Self-defined, you can directly issue hexadecimal or string data during device debugging.
