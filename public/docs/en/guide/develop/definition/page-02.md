# Standard Features

## **What is a Standard Feature?**

Standard features are features in a TSL model that has been defined for the specified product category on Developer Center. If the product category is labeled "Standard" when a product is created, it indicates that a standard TSL model has been defined for that category.

## **Add a Standard Feature**

There are two ways to add a standard feature:

When creating a product, check "Add standard TSL model automatically" and select the data format "TSL". After the product is created, all the standard features defined on Developer Center will be added to the product.

When creating a product, if you do not check "Add standard TSL model automatically" but select the data format "TSL", you can manually add a standard feature after the product is created.

### **Prerequisites**

● When you create a product, select a category with "Standard" label.<br />
● When you create a product, you do not check "Add standard TSL model automatically".



### **Steps**
